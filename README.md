## A Bootstrap extension for the HTML UI builder

This package extends the [HTML UI builder](https://github.com/lagdo/ui-builder) and implements functions to create UI components for Bootstrap 3 and 4.

### Usage

See the [HTML UI builder](https://github.com/lagdo/ui-builder) documentation.
Depending on the Bootstrap version the HTML code, a different class instance must provided where the `Lagdo\UiBuilder\BuilderInterface` is required.

For example, let say this `View` class is used to create HTML code.
```php
use Lagdo\UiBuilder\BuilderInterface;

class View
{
    /**
     * @var BuilderInterface
     */
    protected $uiBuilder;

    /**
     * @param BuilderInterface
     */
    public function __construct(BuilderInterface $uiBuilder)
    {
        $this->uiBuilder = $uiBuilder;
    }
}
```

The following code will generate HTML code for Bootstrap 3.
```php
use Lagdo\UiBuilder\Bootstrap\Bootstrap3\Builder;

$view = new View(new Builder());
```

And the following code will generate HTML code for Bootstrap 4.
```php
use Lagdo\UiBuilder\Bootstrap\Bootstrap4\Builder;

$view = new View(new Builder());
```
